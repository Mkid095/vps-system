It contains:\n- Database tools (query, insert, update, delete)\n- Auth tools (signin, signup)\n- Storage tools (file info, download, list)\n- GraphQL tools\n\n## What flow-convert Actually Is\n\nThe `flow-convert` skill you see listed is **NOT implemented in this codebase**. It's a **Claude Code skill** that comes from a completely different source - likely the Maven Flow project or Claude Code's built-in skill system.\n\n## Key Difference\n\n| This Codebase | flow-convert Skill |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| MCP Server for NextMavens APIs | Claude Code skill for converting PRDs |\n| Installed via npm/package.json | Managed by Claude Code's skill system |\n| Not a terminal command | Not a terminal command |\n\n## To Use flow-convert\n\nYou need to invoke it **through Claude Code**, not in your terminal:\n\n```\n/flow-convert your-prd.md\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.
