The core idea is to create a self-hosted platform that centralizes and optimizes how I deploy and manage applications. Since I primarily use Supabase for databases and backend services, my plan is to self-host Supabase because it’s open source. This gives me full control to disable features I don’t use, reduce overhead, and customize the setup to fit my actual needs. One major goal is to introduce a shared, universal dependency layer so I don’t have to reinstall dependencies every time I spin up a new application.I don’t plan to expose file storage directly to users to avoid abuse. Instead of running one database per account, the idea is to have one master account that can host multiple applications, each with its own isolated database. This platform is meant to support multiple apps—not just a single project.which we will need to build our own I found that self-hosted Supabase does NOT support the organizations → projects flow out of the box (this is proprietary to Supabase Cloud). However, I can implement this flow by building a\n   custom management layer. and implement the organizations → projects → dashboard flow just like the original supabase website there is a supabase module for managing projects and also we need to create mcps for claude code just like the way the website has and uses npx and access tokesn\n \n  I also want to integrate a third-party WhatsApp API (specifically Evolution API), because many of my applications require WhatsApp automation. The goal is to centralize WhatsApp integrations so multiple applications and clients can use it seamlessly. On hosting, I plan to run real-time applications using WebSockets—mostly lightweight use cases like notifications, internal tools, and simple chat features. These won’t be high-traffic systems, especially at the early SaaS stage Storage is another concern. Since the VPS is limited to 100GB, I want a smart storage optimization system. Any images or videos uploaded—especially via email—should be automatically detected, uploaded to Cloudinary, replaced with links, and then deleted from the server. This ensures we preserve space and avoid unnecessary storage bloat. For backups, I want automated external backups for databases and critical files. One idea is to use a private Telegram channel as a backup target, since Telegram supports large file storage (up to 2GB per file). The system would automatically upload small backup files daily and remove older or unnecessary data from the server. The Telegram channel would be private and accessible only to internal team members, acting as a last-resort recovery point in case of system failure. We also plan to integrate MCP servers across different services, including WhatsApp and other application components. Since Docker is already part of the stack, the goal is to automate these integrations as much as possible without manual installations. Domain handling is already partially solved. We have a primary domain, and applications can be accessed via subdomains. Custom domains will also be supported per deployed app. We already own and use nextmavens.cloud, which gives us a solid base to build on. Overall, the objective is to create a unified, cost-efficient platform that allows me to build, deploy, and manage multiple SaaS applications with shared infrastructure, smart automation, minimal recurring costs, and flexible third-party integrations—without unnecessary complexity.\n \non the https://nextmavens.cloud/ i want us to have a dashboard that redirects to all our services our branding needs to be consistent without emojis and gradients, professional layout alone except for external apps like supabase\n \n \nnow rephrase this actually after doing research and give it a proper guide on how to do what and what how to impliment since we have ubuntu plain with user ken  I WANT YOU TO AUDIT WHAT WE HAVE IMPLIMENTED 100% AND THEN TELL ME WHAT WE HAVE LEFT"},"uuid":"047f9a6a-5b4a-44bd-bfdf-9f97ff352c75","timestamp":"2026-01-25T00:00:47.387Z","thinkingMetadata":{"maxThinkingTokens":31999},"permissionMode":"bypassPermissions"}

This setup creates a centralized, self-hosted platform on your Hostinger KVM2 VPS (Ubuntu with user 'ken') for deploying and managing multiple low-traffic SaaS applications. It leverages Docker for orchestration, enabling shared base images to cache common dependencies (e.g., Node.js packages) across containers, avoiding reinstalls during builds. Supabase will be self-hosted in a single instance with schema-based isolation for multi-app databases, as native \"organizations → projects\" is not supported— you'll build a custom layer in your Next.js dashboard using Supabase's pg_meta API, Supavisor for tenant routing, and Kong for custom routing. This simulates the proprietary flow, with npx-style CLI tools and access tokens for project management.\n\nEvolution API integrates centrally via Docker for shared WhatsApp automation, supporting multi-instances for seamless use across apps/clients without manual setups. Real-time features (e.g., WebSockets for notifications/chat) use Supabase Realtime, keeping overhead low. Storage optimization offloads media to Cloudinary (free tier) automatically, replacing uploads with links to fit your 100GB limit—no direct user exposure to file storage. Backups automate daily via a Telegram bot to a private channel (up to 2GB/file), with server cleanup. MCPs (interpreting as \"Management Control Panels\" for AI like Claude to access/interact with Supabase projects via APIs) will be implemented as dashboard modules with API endpoints, npx commands, and tokens—allowing AI-driven code interactions similar to Supabase's web interface.\n\nThe nextmavens.cloud dashboard (built with Next.js) provides a professional, consistent UI (neutral colors, sans-serif fonts, no emojis/gradients except in external tools like Supabase Studio) for redirects to services, org/project flows, and MCPs. Domains use subdomains/custom setups via Nginx. This unified platform minimizes costs (VPS + free tiers), automates integrations, and supports shared infrastructure for multiple apps without complexity.\n\n### Implementation Guide\n\nThis guide is based on the latest research (e.g., Supabase Docker v2025+, Evolution API multi-instance, Docker caching via base images). Assume SSH as 'ken'; use `sudo` for system commands. Focus on automation with Docker Compose. Estimated time: 5-7 hours.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n- VPS IP/domain (nextmavens.cloud A record to IP).\n- Free accounts: Cloudinary (API keys), Telegram (bot/channel), GitHub.\n- Tools: Docker, Node.js, Postgres basics.\n\n#### Step 1: System Setup\nUpdate and install essentials:\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install -y curl git vim ca-certificates gnupg python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Install Docker and Compose\nFor shared layers: Use base images (e.g., `node:20`) in Dockerfiles to cache deps.\n```\nsudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings\nsudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc\nsudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc\necho \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin\nsudo usermod -aG docker ken\nnewgrp docker\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Self-Host Supabase\nSingle instance with schema isolation for multi-app.\n1. Setup:\n   ```\n   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase\n   mkdir supabase-master && cd supabase-master\n   cp -rf ../supabase/docker/* .\n   cp ../supabase/docker/.env.example .env\n   ```\n2. Edit `.env` (generate keys with `openssl rand -base64 32`):\n   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.\n   - `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL=https://nextmavens.cloud/supabase`.\n   - `DASHBOARD_USERNAME=admin`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=strongpass`.\n   - Disable unused (e.g., remove `analytics` from `docker-compose.yml`).\n3. Start:\n   ```\n   docker compose pull\n   docker compose up -d\n   ```\n4. Health: `docker compose ps`. Access Studio: `http://your-ip:8000`.\n\n#### Step 4: Custom Management Layer for Orgs/Projects\nNo native support; use schemas/RLS.\n1. In Studio or psql: Create schemas (`CREATE SCHEMA app1;`), enable RLS.\n2. pg_meta API: For project management (e.g., list tables/roles).\n3. Supavisor: Set `POOLER_TENANT_ID` per app for routing.\n4. Kong: Edit `docker-compose.yml` for custom routes (e.g., subdomain-based).\n5. npx CLI: Create npm package (`npm init -y; npm install supabase`).\n   - Script: `npx nextmavens create-project --org=1 --token=token` calls psql to create schema/role.\n6. MCPs for AI (Claude): Build API endpoints in dashboard (Step 8) using Supabase JS client. Expose as REST API for AI interaction (e.g., `/mcp/claude?token=...` queries DB). Use Anthropic SDK if integrating Claude for code gen.\n\n#### Step 5: Integrate Evolution API\nMulti-instance for shared WhatsApp.\n1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api && cd evolution-api`\n2. Edit `docker-compose.yml`: Set `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY`, add to network (`nextmavens-net`).\n3. Start: `docker compose up -d`\n4. Instances: POST to `/instance/create` for multi-app. Share via API keys.\n5. Network: `docker network create nextmavens-net && docker network connect nextmavens-net supabase-master_kong_1`\n\n#### Step 6: Storage Optimization with Cloudinary\n1. Install SDK in apps: `npm install cloudinary`\n2. Handler example (Node.js):\n   ```\n   const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;\n   cloudinary.config({ cloud_name: 'yourname', api_key: 'key', api_secret: 'secret' });\n   // On upload (e.g., email attachment):\n   cloudinary.uploader.upload('path/to/file', { resource_type: 'auto' }, (err, res) => {\n     if (res) {\n       // Save res.secure_url to DB/email\n       require('fs').unlinkSync('path/to/file');\n     }\n   });\n   ```\n3. Cron cleanup: `crontab -e` add `0 * * * * find /uploads -type f -delete`\n\n#### Step 7: Automated Backups to Telegram\nUse Python script (from azerothcore repo).\n1. Bot: Create via @BotFather; get token. Add to private channel as admin (get chat_id via `/getupdates`).\n2. Script (`backup.py`):\n   ```\n   import os\n   import requests\n   TOKEN = 'your_token'\n   CHAT_ID = 'your_chat_id'\n   os.system('docker exec supabase-master_db_1 pg_dump -U postgres > backup.sql')\n   files = {'document': open('backup.sql', 'rb')}\n   requests.post(f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TOKEN}/sendDocument?chat_id={CHAT_ID}', files=files)\n   os.remove('backup.sql')\n   ```\n3. Install deps: `pip3 install requests`\n4. Schedule: `crontab -e` add `0 0 * * * python3 /path/to/backup.py`\n\n#### Step 8: Build Next.js Dashboard\nFor redirects, orgs/projects, MCPs. RBAC via Supabase Auth.\n1. Node: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs`\n2. App: `npx create-next-app@latest nextmavens-dashboard --ts --eslint --tailwind`\n3. Features:\n   - Auth: `@supabase/supabase-js` for login.\n   - Pages: `/dashboard` redirects (e.g., to Supabase `/supabase`, Evolution `/whatsapp`).\n   - Orgs/Projects: Forms to create (call psql/scripts).\n   - MCPs: Module for AI API (e.g., query DB, generate tokens).\n   - Style: Tailwind – neutral, professional (e.g., font-family: 'Inter').\n4. Deploy: `npm run build; npm i -g pm2; pm2 start npm --name dashboard -- run start`\n5. Nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`\n   ```\n   server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name nextmavens.cloud;\n       location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; }\n   }\n   ```\n   `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx`\n6. HTTPS: `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx; sudo certbot --nginx`\n\n#### Step 9: Real-Time and Domains\n- Realtime: Use Supabase client for WebSockets.\n- Domains: Nginx blocks for subdomains (e.g., `app1.nextmavens.cloud`). Custom: CNAME to your domain.\n\n#### Step 10: Shared Dependencies\nIn app Dockerfiles: Use multi-stage/base images.\nExample:\n```\nFROM node:20 AS base\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY package*.json .\nRUN npm ci  # Cached layer\nCOPY . .\nFROM base AS prod\nRUN npm run build\n```\nReuse `base` across apps.\n\n#### Step 11: Testing/Security\n- Test: Deploy sample app, integrate WhatsApp, backup.\n- Security: `sudo ufw allow 80,443,8000,8080; sudo ufw enable`. Monitor with `docker stats`. I currently have a KVM2 VPS on Hostinger, and this aligns with what I’m trying to build. The core idea is to create a self-hosted platform that centralizes and optimizes how I deploy and manage applications. Since I primarily use Supabase for databases and backend services, my plan is to self-host Supabase because it’s open source. This gives me full control to disable features I don’t use, reduce overhead, and customize the setup to fit my actual needs. One major goal is to introduce a shared, universal dependency layer so I don’t have to reinstall dependencies every time I spin up a new application.I don’t plan to expose file storage directly to users to avoid abuse. Instead of running one database per account, the idea is to have one master account that can host multiple applications, each with its own isolated database. This platform is meant to support multiple apps—not just a single project.which we will need to build our own I found that self-hosted Supabase does NOT support the organizations → projects flow out of the box (this is proprietary to Supabase Cloud). However, I can implement this flow by building a\n   custom management layer. and implement the organizations → projects → dashboard flow just like the original supabase website there is a supabase module for managing projects and also we need to create mcps for our ai to be alt to see the supabase database project, and interact with them like an api, and for claude code just like the way the website has and uses npx and access tokesn\n \n  I also want to integrate a third-party WhatsApp API (specifically Evolution API), because many of my applications require WhatsApp automation. The goal is to centralize WhatsApp integrations so multiple applications and clients can use it seamlessly. On hosting, I plan to run real-time applications using WebSockets—mostly lightweight use cases like notifications, internal tools, and simple chat features. These won’t be high-traffic systems, especially at the early SaaS stage Storage is another concern. Since the VPS is limited to 100GB, I want a smart storage optimization system. Any images or videos uploaded—especially via email—should be automatically detected, uploaded to Cloudinary, replaced with links, and then deleted from the server. This ensures we preserve space and avoid unnecessary storage bloat. For backups, I want automated external backups for databases and critical files. One idea is to use a private Telegram channel as a backup target, since Telegram supports large file storage (up to 2GB per file). The system would automatically upload small backup files daily and remove older or unnecessary data from the server. The Telegram channel would be private and accessible only to internal team members, acting as a last-resort recovery point in case of system failure. We also plan to integrate MCP servers across different services, including WhatsApp and other application components. Since Docker is already part of the stack, the goal is to automate these integrations as much as possible without manual installations. Domain handling is already partially solved. We have a primary domain, and applications can be accessed via subdomains. Custom domains will also be supported per deployed app. We already own and use nextmavens.cloud, which gives us a solid base to build on. Overall, the objective is to create a unified, cost-efficient platform that allows me to build, deploy, and manage multiple SaaS applications with shared infrastructure, smart automation, minimal recurring costs, and flexible third-party integrations—without unnecessary complexity.\n \non the https://nextmavens.cloud/ i want us to have a dashboard that redirects to all our services our branding needs to be consistent without emojis and gradients, professional layout alone except for external apps like supabase\n \n \nnow rephrase this actually after doing research and give it a proper guide on how to do what and what how to impliment since we have ubuntu plain with user ken our main missing was to build this which we have built the major part of it @\"Project-Auditor (agent)\"  I currently have a KVM2 VPS on Hostinger, and this aligns with what I’m trying to build.

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST\n\nFor your Ubuntu VPS with user `ken`:\n\n```bash\n# 1. System setup (if not done)\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose nodejs npm python3 python3-pip\n\n# 2. Clone and setup\ncd /home/ken\ngit clone <your-repo> nextmavens-platform\ncd nextmavens-platform\ncp .env.example .env\n# Edit .env with your values\n\n# 3. Start services\ndocker compose -f docker/supabase.yml up -d\ndocker compose -f docker/evolution.yml up -d\n\n# 4. Build and start dashboard\ncd dashboard\nnpm install\nnpm run build\npm2 start npm --name dashboard -- start\n\n# 5. Install CLI globally\ncd ..\nnpm install -g ./cli\n# Or: npm link\n\n# 6. Set up Nginx\nsudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx\nsudo cp nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextmavens.cloud\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextmavens.cloud /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\nsudo certbot --nginx -d nextmavens.cloud\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The images run in **isolated containers** on your VPS\n\n**Your configuration files define:**\n- Which Docker images to download\n- How to connect them together\n- What ports to expose\n\n### What You ARE Hosting Yourself\n\n| Service | Docker Image | Status | What It Does |\n|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|\n| **Supabase DB** | `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` | ⚪ Not Running | PostgreSQL database |\n| **Supabase Studio** | `supabase/studio:20250115` | ⚪ Not Running | Admin UI (port 8000) |\n| **Supavisor** | `supabase/supavisor:1.1.51` | ⚪ Not Running | Connection pooler (port 4000) |\n| **pg-meta** | `supabase/pg-meta:v0.79.0` | ⚪ Not Running | DB introspection |\n| **Realtime** | `supabase/realtime:v2.31.4` | ⚪ Not Running | WebSockets (port 4001) |\n| **Storage** | `supabase/storage-api:v1.14.2` | ⚪ Not Running | File storage (port 4002) |\n| **PostgREST** | `postgrest/postgrest:v12.2.0` | ⚪ Not Running | REST API (port 4003) |\n| **Kong** | `kong:3.7.1` | ⚪ Not Running | API Gateway |\n| **Evolution API** | `evolutionapi/evolution-api:v2.3.7` | ⚪ Not Running | WhatsApp (port 8080) |\n| **Redis** | `redis:7-alpine` | ⚪ Not Running | Evolution's database (port 6379) |\n\n**Answer: You WILL be hosting everything yourself, but the services are NOT STARTED yet.**\n\n---\n\nLet me check your environment configuration:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"9fd46f78-531f-4078-8217-474c25871dd7","timestamp":"2026-01-25T00:30:05.397Z"}

Here's your complete summary:\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What I Just Did For You\n\n### 1. Created `.env` File\n- Added your Telegram credentials:\n  - **Bot Token:** `8311565035:AAEMMAmLAHM8L7zCnx42F3J3W4mcUfw4yhQ`\n  - **Chat ID:** `7809186882`\n  - **Channel ID:** `-3876778158`\n- Added placeholder keys for Cloudinary and Resend (you need to add yours)\n\n### 2. Created Telegram Backup Script\n- **Location:** `/home/ken/nextmavens-platform/scripts/telegram-backup.py`\n- **Features:**\n  - Backs up PostgreSQL database\n  - Compresses backups (.gz)\n  - Uploads to your Telegram channel\n  - Keeps only 3 local backups (saves space)\n  - Daily automatic backup at 2 AM\n\n### 3. Created Startup Script\n- **Location:** `/home/ken/nextmavens-platform/scripts/start-all.sh`\n- Starts Supabase and Evolution API with one command\n\n### 4. Set Up Cron Job\n- Runs daily at 2:00 AM automatically\n\n---\n\n## Answering Your Question: How Does Your Setup Work?\n\n### What You WILL Be Hosting Yourself:\n\n| Service | Status | Port | Access URL |\n|---------|--------|------|------------|\n| **PostgreSQL** | Docker image | 5432 | Internal |\n| **Supabase Studio** | Docker image | 8000 | `nextmavens.cloud/studio` |\n| **Realtime** | Docker image | 4001 | Internal |\n| **Storage** | Docker image | 4002 | Internal |\n| **PostgREST** | Docker image | 4003 | `nextmavens.cloud/api` |\n| **Kong Gateway** | Docker image | 8001 | Internal |\n| **Evolution API** | Docker image | 8080 | `nextmavens.cloud/whatsapp` |\n| **Redis** | Docker image | 6379 | Internal |\n\n### How It Works (Simple Explanation):\n\n1. **Docker** downloads pre-built images from Docker Hub (NOT GitHub)\n2. These images run as **containers** on your VPS\n3. The containers are connected together via **Docker networks**\n4. Your code communicates with these containers locally\n\n**You ARE hosting everything yourself** - no external dependencies except:\n- Cloudinary (for image storage) - optional\n- Resend (for email) - optional\n- Telegram (for backups) - already set up\n\n---\n\n## What You Need To Do Next\n\n### Step 1: Add Your Cloudinary Keys (Optional)\nEdit `.env` and add your Cloudinary credentials:\n```bash\nnano /home/ken/nextmavens-platform/.env\n```\n\nAdd your keys:\n```env\nCLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name\nCLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key\nCLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret\nCLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_preset\n```\n\n### Step 2: Start All Services\n```bash\ncd /home/ken/nextmavens-platform\n./scripts/start-all.sh\n```\n\n### Step 3: Initialize the Database\n```bash\n# Connect to the running database\ndocker exec -it supabase-db psql -U postgres\n\n# Then run the schema initialization\n\\i /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql\n```\n\n### Step 4: Access Your Services\n- **Supabase Studio:** http://your-ip:8000\n- **Dashboard:** Start with `cd dashboard && npm run dev`\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Commands\n\n```bash\n# Start all services\n./scripts/start-all.sh\n\n# Stop all services\ndocker compose -f docker/supabase.yml down\ndocker compose -f docker/evolution.yml down\n\n# View running containers\ndocker ps\n\n# View logs\ndocker logs supabase-db\ndocker logs evolution-api\n\n# Manual backup\npython3 scripts/telegram-backup.py\n\n# View cron jobs\ncrontab -l\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to start the services now and initialize the database?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"99ac7266-a59b-4b55-a1ab-277eb9693b03","timestamp":"2026-01-25T00:40:56.472Z"}

The API supports both PostgreSQL and MySQL, using Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to facilitate interaction with these databases.\\n\\n## Database Choice\\n\\nEvolution API v2 offers the flexibility to choose between PostgreSQL and MySQL as the database provider. The choice can be configured through the `DATABASE_PROVIDER` environment variable, and connections are managed by Prisma.\\n\\n## Installation and Configuration\\n\\n### Using Docker\\n\\nThe easiest and fastest way to set up a database for Evolution API v2 is through Docker. Below are the instructions to configure both PostgreSQL and MySQL using Docker Compose.\\n\\n#### PostgreSQL\\n\\nTo set up PostgreSQL via Docker, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file for PostgreSQL available here.\\n2. Navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded and run the command:\\n\\n3. The PostgreSQL instance will be available at `localhost` on port `5432`.\\n\\n#### MySQL\\n\\nTo set up MySQL via Docker, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Download the `docker-compose.yaml` file for MySQL available here.\\n2. Navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded and run the command:\\n\\n3. The MySQL instance will be available at `localhost` on port `3306`.\\n\\n### Environment Variables Configuration\\n\\nAfter setting up the database, define the following environment variables in your `.env` file:\\n\\n```\\n# Enable the use of the database\\nDATABASE_ENABLED=true\\n\\n# Choose the database provider: postgresql or mysql\\nDATABASE_PROVIDER=postgresql\\n\\n# Database connection URI\\nDATABASE_CONNECTION_URI='postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/evolution?schema=public'\\n\\n# Client name for the database connection\\nDATABASE_CONNECTION_CLIENT_NAME=evolution_exchange\\n\\n# Choose the data you want to save in the application database\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_INSTANCE=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_NEW_MESSAGE=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_MESSAGE_UPDATE=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_CONTACTS=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_CHATS=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_LABELS=true\\nDATABASE_SAVE_DATA_HISTORIC=true\\n```\\n\\n### Local Installation\\n\\nIf you prefer to set up the database locally without using Docker, follow the instructions below:\\n\\n#### PostgreSQL\\n\\n1. Install PostgreSQL on your machine. On Ubuntu-based systems, for example, you can use:\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib\\n```\\n\\n2. Start the PostgreSQL service:\\n\\n```\\nsudo service postgresql start\\n```\\n\\n3. Create a database for Evolution API v2:\\n\\n```\\nsudo -u postgres createdb evolution\\n```\\n\\n#### MySQL\\n\\n1. Install MySQL on your machine. On Ubuntu-based systems, you can use:\\n\\n```\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server\\n```\\n\\n2. Start the MySQL service:\\n\\n3. Create a database for Evolution API v2:\\n\\n```\\nmysql -u root -p -e \\\"CREATE DATABASE evolution;\\\"\\n```\", \"metadata\": {\"application-name\": \"Evolution API Documentation\", \"charset\": \"utf-8\", \"msapplication-config\": \"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/_generated/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=3\", \"og:image\": \"https://atendai-eb1f2775.mintlify.app/mintlify-assets/_next/image?url=%2F_mintlify%2Fapi%2Fog%3Fdivision%3DRequirements%26title%3DDatabase%26logoLight%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com%252Fatendai-eb1f2775%252Fimages%252Fbrand%252Fcover.png%26logoDark%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com%252Fatendai-eb1f2775%252Fimages%252Fbrand%252Fcover-white.png%26primaryColor%3D%252349BC94%26lightColor%3D%252349BC94%26darkColor%3D%252349BC94%26backgroundLight%3D%2523ffffff%26backgroundDark%3D%252318181B&w=1200&q=100\", \"og:image:width\": \"1200\", \"og:type\": \"website\", \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\", \"twitter:title\": \"Database - Evolution API Documentation\", \"og:site_name\": \"Evolution API Documentation\", \"apple-mobile-web-app-title\": \"Evolution API Documentation\", \"og:title\": \"Database - Evolution API Documentation\", \"og:image:height\": \"630\", \"twitter:image:height\": \"630\", \"generator\": \"Mintlify\", \"canonical\": \"https://doc.evolution-api.com/v2/en/requirements/database\", \"twitter:image\": \"https://atendai-eb1f2775.mintlify.app/mintlify-assets/_next/image?url=%2F_mintlify%2Fapi%2Fog%3Fdivision%3DRequirements%26title%3DDatabase%26logoLight%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com%252Fatendai-eb1f2775%252Fimages%252Fbrand%252Fcover.png%26logoDark%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com%252Fatendai-eb1f2775%252Fimages%252Fbrand%252Fcover-white.png%26primaryColor%3D%252349BC94%26lightColor%3D%252349BC94%26darkColor%3D%252349BC94%26backgroundLight%3D%2523ffffff%26backgroundDark%3D%252318181B&w=1200&q=100\", \"msapplication-TileColor\": \"#49BC94\", \"twitter:image:width\": \"1200\", \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\", \"lang\": \"en\", \"og:url\": \"https://doc.evolution-api.com/v2/en/requirements/database\"}, \"external\": {\"stylesheet\": {\"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/css/9e8832c8599d2dba.css?dpl=dpl_6HQcaA3T8q8UyL1S6KDhCscpxL4J\": {}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/css/75d551315dbd37b5.css?dpl=dpl_6HQcaA3T8q8UyL1S6KDhCscpxL4J\": {}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/css/fca243b2cdab0ff2.css?dpl=dpl_6HQcaA3T8q8UyL1S6KDhCscpxL4J\": {}}, \"shortcut\": {\"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/_generated/favicon/favicon.ico?v=3\": {\"type\": \"image/x-icon\"}}, \"icon\": {\"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/_generated/favicon/favicon-16x16.png?v=3\": {\"sizes\": \"16x16\", \"type\": \"image/png\"}, \"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/_generated/favicon/favicon-32x32.png?v=3\": {\"sizes\": \"32x32\", \"type\": \"image/png\"}}, \"alternate\": {\"/sitemap.xml\": {\"type\": \"application/xml\"}}, \"canonical\": {\"https://doc.evolution-api.com/v2/en/requirements/database\": {}}, \"preload\": {\"https://d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net/katex.min.css\": {}, \"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/images/brand/cover-white.png\": {}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/media/e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2\": {\"type\": \"font/woff2\"}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/chunks/webpack-e627985ad9852b1b.js?dpl=dpl_6HQcaA3T8q8UyL1S6KDhCscpxL4J\": {}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/media/bb3ef058b751a6ad-s.p.woff2\": {\"type\": \"font/woff2\"}, \"/mintlify-assets/_next/static/media/c4b700dcb2187787-s.p.woff2\": {\"type\": \"font/woff2\"}, \"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/images/brand/cover.png\": {}}, \"apple-touch-icon\": {\"https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/atendai-eb1f2775/_generated/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png?v=3\": {\"sizes\": \"180x180\", \"type\": \"image/png\"}}}}]"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"b367491c-1310-458d-8680-d2f9e3f464e7","timestamp":"2026-01-25T01:06:38.619Z"}

Login to your domain registrar's control panel (where you bought your domain)\n2. Find the DNS/Nameserver settings\n3. Remove existing nameservers\n4. Add both nameservers:\n   - `ns1.dns-parking.com`\n   - `ns2.dns-parking.com`\n5.

While originally focused on WhatsApp, Evolution API has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging services and integrations. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.\\n\\nToday, Evolution API is not limited to WhatsApp. It integrates with various platforms such as Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI, offering a broad array of functionalities beyond messaging. Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp API and the official WhatsApp Business API, with upcoming support for Instagram and Messenger.\\n\\n## Looking for a Lightweight Version?\\nFor those who need a more streamlined and performance-optimized version, check out [Evolution API Lite](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api-lite). It's designed specifically for microservices, focusing solely on connectivity without integrations or audio conversion features. Ideal for environments that prioritize simplicity and efficiency.\\n\\n## Types of Connections\\n\\nEvolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, enabling flexible and powerful integration options:\\n\\n- *WhatsApp API - Baileys*:\\n  - A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).\\n  - This connection type allows control over WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and other WhatsApp-integrated systems.\\n  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.\\n\\n- *WhatsApp Cloud API*:\\n  - The official API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).\\n  - This connection type offers a robust and reliable solution designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.\\n  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.\\n  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta's policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nEvolution API supports various integrations to enhance its functionality. Below is a list of available integrations and their uses:\\n\\n- [Typebot](https://typebot.io/):\\n  - Build conversational bots using Typebot, integrated directly into Evolution with trigger management.\\n\\n- [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/):\\n  - Direct integration with Chatwoot for handling customer service for your business.\\n\\n- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via RabbitMQ.\\n\\n- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Apache Kafka for real-time event streaming and processing.\\n\\n- [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sqs/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Amazon SQS.\\n\\n- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via WebSocket.\\n\\n- [Dify](https://dify.ai/):\\n  - Integrate your Evolution API directly with Dify AI for seamless trigger management and multiple agents.\\n\\n- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):\\n  - Integrate your Evolution API with OpenAI for AI capabilities, including audio-to-text conversion, available across all Evolution integrations.\\n\\n- Amazon S3 / Minio:\\n  - Store media files received in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/) or [Minio](https://min.io/).\\n\\n## Community & Feedback\\n\\nWe value community input and feedback to continuously improve Evolution API:\\n\\n### 🚀 Feature Requests & Roadmap\\n- **[Feature Requests](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/feature-requests)**: Submit new feature ideas and vote on community proposals\\n- **[Roadmap](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/feature-requests)**: View planned features and development progress\\n- **[Changelog](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/changelog)**: Stay updated with the latest releases and improvements\\n\\n### 💬 Community Support\\n- **[WhatsApp Group](https://evolution-api.com/whatsapp)**: Join our community for support and discussions\\n- **[Discord Community](https://evolution-api.com/discord)**: Real-time chat with developers and users\\n- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api/issues)**: Report bugs and technical issues\\n\\n### 🔒 Security\\n- **[Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)**: Guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities\\n- **Security Contact**: contato@evolution-api.com\\n\\n## Telemetry Notice\\n\\nTo continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use.

While originally focused on WhatsApp, Evolution API has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging services and integrations. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.\\n\\nToday, Evolution API is not limited to WhatsApp. It integrates with various platforms such as Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, and OpenAI, offering a broad array of functionalities beyond messaging. Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp API and the official WhatsApp Business API, with upcoming support for Instagram and Messenger.\\n\\n## Looking for a Lightweight Version?\\nFor those who need a more streamlined and performance-optimized version, check out [Evolution API Lite](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api-lite). It's designed specifically for microservices, focusing solely on connectivity without integrations or audio conversion features. Ideal for environments that prioritize simplicity and efficiency.\\n\\n## Types of Connections\\n\\nEvolution API supports multiple types of connections to WhatsApp, enabling flexible and powerful integration options:\\n\\n- *WhatsApp API - Baileys*:\\n  - A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).\\n  - This connection type allows control over WhatsApp Web functionalities through a RESTful API, suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and other WhatsApp-integrated systems.\\n  - Note: This method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.\\n\\n- *WhatsApp Cloud API*:\\n  - The official API provided by Meta (formerly Facebook).\\n  - This connection type offers a robust and reliable solution designed for businesses needing higher volumes of messaging and better integration support.\\n  - The Cloud API supports features such as end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and more comprehensive customer service tools.\\n  - To use this API, you must comply with Meta's policies and potentially pay for usage based on message volume and other factors.\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\nEvolution API supports various integrations to enhance its functionality. Below is a list of available integrations and their uses:\\n\\n- [Typebot](https://typebot.io/):\\n  - Build conversational bots using Typebot, integrated directly into Evolution with trigger management.\\n\\n- [Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/):\\n  - Direct integration with Chatwoot for handling customer service for your business.\\n\\n- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via RabbitMQ.\\n\\n- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Apache Kafka for real-time event streaming and processing.\\n\\n- [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sqs/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via Amazon SQS.\\n\\n- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/):\\n  - Receive events from the Evolution API via WebSocket.\\n\\n- [Dify](https://dify.ai/):\\n  - Integrate your Evolution API directly with Dify AI for seamless trigger management and multiple agents.\\n\\n- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/):\\n  - Integrate your Evolution API with OpenAI for AI capabilities, including audio-to-text conversion, available across all Evolution integrations.\\n\\n- Amazon S3 / Minio:\\n  - Store media files received in [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/s3/) or [Minio](https://min.io/).\\n\\n## Community & Feedback\\n\\nWe value community input and feedback to continuously improve Evolution API:\\n\\n### 🚀 Feature Requests & Roadmap\\n- **[Feature Requests](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/feature-requests)**: Submit new feature ideas and vote on community proposals\\n- **[Roadmap](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/feature-requests)**: View planned features and development progress\\n- **[Changelog](https://evolutionapi.canny.io/changelog)**: Stay updated with the latest releases and improvements\\n\\n### 💬 Community Support\\n- **[WhatsApp Group](https://evolution-api.com/whatsapp)**: Join our community for support and discussions\\n- **[Discord Community](https://evolution-api.com/discord)**: Real-time chat with developers and users\\n- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api/issues)**: Report bugs and technical issues\\n\\n### 🔒 Security\\n- **[Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)**: Guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities\\n- **Security Contact**: contato@evolution-api.com\\n\\n## Telemetry Notice\\n\\nTo continuously improve our services, we have implemented telemetry that collects data on the routes used, the most accessed routes, and the version of the API in use.

Pending Tasks:\n   - Create proper dashboard UI with service redirects (supabase, whatsapp)\n   - Build custom organizations → projects flow UI\n   - Implement Evolution Manager v2 or custom WhatsApp management UI\n   - Add Cloudinary integration for automatic media upload\n   - Complete npx CLI package for distribution\n   - Fix any remaining Supabase Studio 404 issues\n   - Configure Kong API Gateway for per-project routing\n   - Implement custom domain support per app\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Just completed:\n   - Installing all MCP servers with provided API key\n   - Researching Evolution API documentation using MCP tools\n   - Updating JWT secrets in .env file\n   - Updating dashboard .env.local with proper Supabase configuration\n   - Restarting Supabase services with new configuration\n   - Restarting dashboard to pick up new environment variables\n\n   Test results show:\n   - Main page: 307 (redirecting to login)\n   - Evolution API: 200 (working)\n   - Supabase Studio: 307 (redirecting to /project/default)\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue fixing the dashboard login issue and create the service management flow. The user explicitly requested: \"we need to create a dashboard flow, that can redirect someone to the supabase and whatsapp, and then since something like supabase just works for one project, we need to create our own flow, and then for whatsapp evolution api, it does not have any ui so we need to configure correctly so that we have our own\"\n   \n   Next immediate action: Test the dashboard login page with the updated Supabase configuration and verify if auth is working. If login works, proceed to create the services page that redirects to Supabase Studio and WhatsApp management.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/ken/.claude/projects/-home-ken-nextmavens-platform/85163fa2-25bd-44de-b652-23499cafe7f7.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions.

The last task was fixing the dashboard login issue with the updated Supabase configuration. Let me check the current state of things:\n\n1. The dashboard has been configured with Supabase environment variables\n2. The Supabase client is configured in `/home/ken/nextmavens-platform/dashboard/src/lib/supabase.ts`\n3. There's a sign-in page at `/auth/signin` and a login redirect at `/login`\n\nThe user reported the dashboard was showing \"page isn't working\" and after fixing the IPv6 issue, it redirects to the login page but still shows issues.\n\nLooking at the code I've read:\n1. `.env.local` has the Supabase configuration\n2. `supabase.ts` creates a client with auth configuration\n3. `page.tsx` in `/auth/signin` has a sign-in form\n4. `/login` redirects to `/auth/signin`\n\nThe issue might be:\n1. The Supabase anon key in the `.env.local` looks like a placeholder/fake JWT - it has \"anon\" and \"service\" at the end which are suspicious\n2. The JWT_SECRET in the main .env might not match what's being used\n\nLet me test the dashboard and see if there are any errors.
