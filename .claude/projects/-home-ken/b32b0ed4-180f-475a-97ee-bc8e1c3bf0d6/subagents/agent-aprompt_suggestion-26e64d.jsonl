Here's what was done:\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 1. **lock.sh** - Added missing functions:\n- `find_and_lock_story()` - Finds the next available incomplete story and locks it\n- `unlock_story()` - Alias for `release_story_lock()`\n- `update_session_heartbeats()` - Updates heartbeat for all locks owned by this session\n\n### 2. **flow-work-story.md** - Added lock steps:\n- **STEP 0**: Acquire story lock before starting work\n- **Heartbeat updates** after each agent step\n- **Automatic lock release** on exit via trap\n\n## How It Works Now\n\n1. **flow.sh** calls `find_and_lock_story()` to get the next available story\n2. **Story gets locked** with session ID and PID\n3. **Heartbeat loop** runs every 60 seconds updating timestamps\n4. **flow-work-story** acquires lock, works on story, updates heartbeat\n5. **On completion**, lock is released via trap\n6. **Stale detection**: If heartbeat > 5 minutes old, lock is considered stale\n\n## Lock Files Location\n\nLocks are stored in `.flow-locks/`:\n- `{hash}-story.lock.data` - Story lock data with heartbeat timestamp\n\n## Commits Pushed\n\n- `6e34605` - \"feat: enable heartbeat system for story locking\"\n- `f43a279` - \"feat: add lock acquisition to flow-work-story command\""}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"e97b301b-428a-4002-b88a-65f2e04be215","timestamp":"2026-01-29T11:53:41.267Z"}
