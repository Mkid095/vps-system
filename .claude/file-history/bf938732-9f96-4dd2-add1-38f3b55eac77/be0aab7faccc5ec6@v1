# Control Plane API Service - Consolidated Implementation Memory

## System Overview
Extract control routes into standalone authoritative API service that separates the control plane from the UI layer. This creates the foundational API boundary that CLI, automation, CI/CD, and the developer portal will all consume.

## Current Status
PRD created, waiting for execution.

## Technical Approach
Create standalone Next.js service at `/home/ken/control-plane-api/` with REST API endpoints for all governance operations. Implement API versioning support (/v1/, /v2/) and shared authentication/DB libraries that can be consumed by both the control plane and other services.
