# CLI Tool - Consolidated Implementation Memory

## System Overview
Standalone CLI tool that provides terminal-based workflows for developers who prefer command-line interfaces over UI. Serious developers don't click UI for everything - CLI is essential for team adoption and CI/CD integration.

## Current Status
PRD created, waiting for execution.

## Technical Approach
Create Node.js CLI package at `/home/ken/nextmavens-cli/` using oclif or yargs framework. CLI acts as a thin wrapper around the Control Plane API, storing authentication tokens and project configuration locally. Distribute via npm for easy installation.

## Related PRDs
- Control Plane API Service (consumes)
- Control Plane Snapshot Contract (indirect)
