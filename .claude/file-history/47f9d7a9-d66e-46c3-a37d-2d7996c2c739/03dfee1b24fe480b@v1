# Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview
Scaling roadmap. Current single-region deployment. Scaling phases. Regional data isolation. Disaster recovery plans. Transparent about current state and future plans.

## Technical Approach
Document current infrastructure honestly. Show what's single-region. Define scaling phases. Explain how data isolation works at scale. Document disaster recovery approach. Be transparent about limitations.
