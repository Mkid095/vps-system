# Platform Invariants Document - Consolidated Implementation Memory

## System Overview
Internal architectural rules document that prevents drift and ensures all contributors understand the core principles of the NextMavens platform. This is NOT user documentation - it's for platform engineers and contributors.

## Current Status
PRD created, waiting for execution.

## Technical Approach
Create /home/ken/PLATFORM_INVARIANTS.md documenting the 10 core principles that govern the platform architecture. Include rules for control plane vs data plane separation, security principles, and observability requirements. Create symlink in developer portal directory for easy access.
