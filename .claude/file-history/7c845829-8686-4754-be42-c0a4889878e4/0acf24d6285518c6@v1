# Dashboard UI

## Overview
Build a Next.js 15+ TypeScript dashboard with Tailwind CSS for managing NextMavens Platform. Professional design with Inter font, neutral colors, no emojis/gradients. Integrate Supabase Auth, provide organizations→projects navigation, service redirects, and real-time notifications.

## Technical Approach
- Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with professional color palette (slate/zinc)
- Supabase Auth for authentication
- Client-side Supabase client with RLS
- Realtime subscriptions for live updates
- Server Actions for mutations
