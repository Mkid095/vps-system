  "description": "Based on research findings from Supabase GitHub discussions:\n- Self-hosted Supabase is single-tenant by design\n- Each project needs its own Docker stack (Studio, PostgREST, GoTrue, etc.)\n- Supabase Cloud uses separate instances per project, the dashboard just unifies the view\n\nImplementation plan:\n1. Create dynamic Studio provisioning system\n2. When project is created, spin up project-specific Studio container\n3. Each Studio runs on unique port (3001, 3002, etc.)\n4. nginx routes /studio/{project-slug} to correct Studio container\n5. Remove old /studio/[slug] Dashboard page (replace with direct Studio access)\n\nTechnical approach:\n- Add docker-compose override for per-project Studios\n- Create API endpoint to provision Studio container\n- Update nginx config dynamically with regex for /studio/{slug}\n- Each Studio connects to its project's database via env vars\n\nFiles to modify:\n- docker/docker-compose.yml: Add project-studio template service\n- docker/nginx-studio.conf: Per-project Studio routing\n- dashboard/src/app/api/projects/[id]/provision-studio: New API endpoint\n- Remove: dashboard/src/app/studio/[slug]/page.tsx (no longer needed)\n- Update components to link to /studio/{slug} directly",

For true multi-project: Each project needs complete Docker stack (db, postgrest, gotrue, studio) on different ports\n3. Alternative: Use pgAdmin or other DB tools that support multi-database management"
