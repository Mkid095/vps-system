Add deleted_at, deletion_scheduled_at, grace_period_ends_at columns\n3. Calculate dependencies: schemas, api_keys, webhooks, edge_functions, storage_buckets, secrets\n4. Show preview with what will be deleted and impact\n5. Implement 30-day grace period before hard delete\n6. Create restore functionality during grace period\n7. Update deletion API to use soft delete first\n\nThis builds trust by showing exactly what will happen.",
