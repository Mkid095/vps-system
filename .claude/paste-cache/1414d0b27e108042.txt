  We couldn't find the page that you're looking for!

  Head back


  and then for whatsapp, I dont think it has a ui but also for it I got {"status":404,"error":"Not Found","response":{"message":["Cannot GET
  /whatsapp"]}}Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()

  i want you to do this, since we already know what we want and have implimented it  we need to know where we have gone wrong in our
  implimentations and configurations and ui matters, so we need to create a dashboard flow, that can redirect someone to the supabase and
  whatsapp, and then since something like supabase just works for one project, we need to create our own flow, and then for whatsapp evolution
  api, it does not have any ui so we need to configure correctly so that we have our own, and it communicates with the apis and tells us the
  next steps and flow and managing existing accounts, first understand what you have implimented, then do reseaearch using[mcp]
  web-search-prime and [mcp] web-reader for research and then once you find the correct implimentations fix all of them
