I currently have a KVM2 VPS on Hostinger, and this aligns with what I’m trying to build. The core idea is to create a self-hosted platform that centralizes and optimizes how I deploy and manage applications. Since I primarily use Supabase for databases and backend services, my plan is to self-host Supabase because it’s open source. This gives me full control to disable features I don’t use, reduce overhead, and customize the setup to fit my actual needs. One major goal is to introduce a shared, universal dependency layer so I don’t have to reinstall dependencies every time I spin up a new application.I don’t plan to expose file storage directly to users to avoid abuse. Instead of running one database per account, the idea is to have one master account that can host multiple applications, each with its own isolated database. This platform is meant to support multiple apps—not just a single project.which we will need to build our own I found that self-hosted Supabase does NOT support the organizations → projects flow out of the box (this is proprietary to Supabase Cloud). However, I can implement this flow by building a
   custom management layer. and implement the organizations → projects → dashboard flow just like the original supabase website there is a supabase module for managing projects and also we need to create mcps for claude code just like the way the website has and uses npx and access tokesn
 
  I also want to integrate a third-party WhatsApp API (specifically Evolution API), because many of my applications require WhatsApp automation. The goal is to centralize WhatsApp integrations so multiple applications and clients can use it seamlessly. On hosting, I plan to run real-time applications using WebSockets—mostly lightweight use cases like notifications, internal tools, and simple chat features. These won’t be high-traffic systems, especially at the early SaaS stage Storage is another concern. Since the VPS is limited to 100GB, I want a smart storage optimization system. Any images or videos uploaded—especially via email—should be automatically detected, uploaded to Cloudinary, replaced with links, and then deleted from the server. This ensures we preserve space and avoid unnecessary storage bloat. For backups, I want automated external backups for databases and critical files. One idea is to use a private Telegram channel as a backup target, since Telegram supports large file storage (up to 2GB per file). The system would automatically upload small backup files daily and remove older or unnecessary data from the server. The Telegram channel would be private and accessible only to internal team members, acting as a last-resort recovery point in case of system failure. We also plan to integrate MCP servers across different services, including WhatsApp and other application components. Since Docker is already part of the stack, the goal is to automate these integrations as much as possible without manual installations. Domain handling is already partially solved. We have a primary domain, and applications can be accessed via subdomains. Custom domains will also be supported per deployed app. We already own and use nextmavens.cloud, which gives us a solid base to build on. Overall, the objective is to create a unified, cost-efficient platform that allows me to build, deploy, and manage multiple SaaS applications with shared infrastructure, smart automation, minimal recurring costs, and flexible third-party integrations—without unnecessary complexity.
 
on the https://nextmavens.cloud/ i want us to have a dashboard that redirects to all our services our branding needs to be consistent without emojis and gradients, professional layout alone except for external apps like supabase
 
 
now rephrase this actually after doing research and give it a proper guide on how to do what and what how to impliment since we have ubuntu plain with user ken
