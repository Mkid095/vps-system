I currently have a KVM2 VPS on Hostinger, and this aligns with what I’m trying to build. The core idea is to create a self-hosted platform that centralizes and optimizes how I deploy and manage applications. Since I primarily use Supabase for databases and backend services, my plan is to self-host Supabase because it’s open source. This gives me full control to disable features I don’t use, reduce overhead, and customize the setup to fit my actual needs. One major goal is to introduce a shared, universal dependency layer so I don’t have to reinstall dependencies every time I spin up a new application.I don’t plan to expose file storage directly to users to avoid abuse. Instead of running one database per account, the idea is to have one master account that can host multiple applications, each with its own isolated database. This platform is meant to support multiple apps—not just a single project.which we will need to build our own I found that self-hosted Supabase does NOT support the organizations → projects flow out of the box (this is proprietary to Supabase Cloud). However, I can implement this flow by building a

   custom management layer. and implement the organizations → projects → dashboard flow just like the original supabase website there is a supabase module for managing projects and also we need to create mcps for our ai to be alt to see the supabase database project, and interact with them like an api, and for claude code just like the way the website has and uses npx and access tokesn

 

  I also want to integrate a third-party WhatsApp API (specifically Evolution API), because many of my applications require WhatsApp automation. The goal is to centralize WhatsApp integrations so multiple applications and clients can use it seamlessly. On hosting, I plan to run real-time applications using WebSockets—mostly lightweight use cases like notifications, internal tools, and simple chat features. These won’t be high-traffic systems, especially at the early SaaS stage Storage is another concern. Since the VPS is limited to 100GB, I want a smart storage optimization system. Any images or videos uploaded—especially via email—should be automatically detected, uploaded to Cloudinary, replaced with links, and then deleted from the server. This ensures we preserve space and avoid unnecessary storage bloat. For backups, I want automated external backups for databases and critical files. One idea is to use a private Telegram channel as a backup target, since Telegram supports large file storage (up to 2GB per file). The system would automatically upload small backup files daily and remove older or unnecessary data from the server. The Telegram channel would be private and accessible only to internal team members, acting as a last-resort recovery point in case of system failure. We also plan to integrate MCP servers across different services, including WhatsApp and other application components. Since Docker is already part of the stack, the goal is to automate these integrations as much as possible without manual installations. Domain handling is already partially solved. We have a primary domain, and applications can be accessed via subdomains. Custom domains will also be supported per deployed app. We already own and use nextmavens.cloud, which gives us a solid base to build on. Overall, the objective is to create a unified, cost-efficient platform that allows me to build, deploy, and manage multiple SaaS applications with shared infrastructure, smart automation, minimal recurring costs, and flexible third-party integrations—without unnecessary complexity.

 

on the https://nextmavens.cloud/ i want us to have a dashboard that redirects to all our services our branding needs to be consistent without emojis and gradients, professional layout alone except for external apps like supabase

 

 

now rephrase this actually after doing research and give it a proper guide on how to do what and what how to impliment since we have ubuntu plain with user ken### Rephrased Project Overview

After researching Supabase self-hosting documentation, Evolution API GitHub, Docker best practices for shared layers, Telegram backup automation scripts (e.g., via Python and bot APIs), Cloudinary SDK integrations, and Next.js tutorials for custom dashboards (including RBAC and service management), here's a refined version of your project. This setup creates a centralized, self-hosted platform on your Hostinger KVM2 VPS (Ubuntu with user 'ken') for deploying and managing multiple low-traffic SaaS applications. It leverages Docker for orchestration, enabling shared base images to cache common dependencies (e.g., Node.js packages) across containers, avoiding reinstalls during builds. Supabase will be self-hosted in a single instance with schema-based isolation for multi-app databases, as native "organizations → projects" is not supported— you'll build a custom layer in your Next.js dashboard using Supabase's pg_meta API, Supavisor for tenant routing, and Kong for custom routing. This simulates the proprietary flow, with npx-style CLI tools and access tokens for project management.

Evolution API integrates centrally via Docker for shared WhatsApp automation, supporting multi-instances for seamless use across apps/clients without manual setups. Real-time features (e.g., WebSockets for notifications/chat) use Supabase Realtime, keeping overhead low. Storage optimization offloads media to Cloudinary (free tier) automatically, replacing uploads with links to fit your 100GB limit—no direct user exposure to file storage. Backups automate daily via a Telegram bot to a private channel (up to 2GB/file), with server cleanup. MCPs (interpreting as "Management Control Panels" for AI like Claude to access/interact with Supabase projects via APIs) will be implemented as dashboard modules with API endpoints, npx commands, and tokens—allowing AI-driven code interactions similar to Supabase's web interface.

The nextmavens.cloud dashboard (built with Next.js) provides a professional, consistent UI (neutral colors, sans-serif fonts, no emojis/gradients except in external tools like Supabase Studio) for redirects to services, org/project flows, and MCPs. Domains use subdomains/custom setups via Nginx. This unified platform minimizes costs (VPS + free tiers), automates integrations, and supports shared infrastructure for multiple apps without complexity.

### Implementation Guide

This guide is based on the latest research (e.g., Supabase Docker v2025+, Evolution API multi-instance, Docker caching via base images). Assume SSH as 'ken'; use `sudo` for system commands. Focus on automation with Docker Compose. Estimated time: 5-7 hours.

#### Prerequisites

- VPS IP/domain (nextmavens.cloud A record to IP).

- Free accounts: Cloudinary (API keys), Telegram (bot/channel), GitHub.

- Tools: Docker, Node.js, Postgres basics.

#### Step 1: System Setup

Update and install essentials:

```

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install -y curl git vim ca-certificates gnupg python3 python3-pip

```

#### Step 2: Install Docker and Compose

For shared layers: Use base images (e.g., `node:20`) in Dockerfiles to cache deps.

```

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update

sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

sudo usermod -aG docker ken

newgrp docker

```

#### Step 3: Self-Host Supabase

Single instance with schema isolation for multi-app.

1. Setup:

   ```

   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

   mkdir supabase-master && cd supabase-master

   cp -rf ../supabase/docker/* .

   cp ../supabase/docker/.env.example .env

   ```

2. Edit `.env` (generate keys with `openssl rand -base64 32`):

   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

   - `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL=https://nextmavens.cloud/supabase`.

   - `DASHBOARD_USERNAME=admin`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=strongpass`.

   - Disable unused (e.g., remove `analytics` from `docker-compose.yml`).

3. Start:

   ```

   docker compose pull

   docker compose up -d

   ```

4. Health: `docker compose ps`. Access Studio: `http://your-ip:8000`.

#### Step 4: Custom Management Layer for Orgs/Projects

No native support; use schemas/RLS.

1. In Studio or psql: Create schemas (`CREATE SCHEMA app1;`), enable RLS.

2. pg_meta API: For project management (e.g., list tables/roles).

3. Supavisor: Set `POOLER_TENANT_ID` per app for routing.

4. Kong: Edit `docker-compose.yml` for custom routes (e.g., subdomain-based).

5. npx CLI: Create npm package (`npm init -y; npm install supabase`).

   - Script: `npx nextmavens create-project --org=1 --token=token` calls psql to create schema/role.

6. MCPs for AI (Claude): Build API endpoints in dashboard (Step 8) using Supabase JS client. Expose as REST API for AI interaction (e.g., `/mcp/claude?token=...` queries DB). Use Anthropic SDK if integrating Claude for code gen.

#### Step 5: Integrate Evolution API

Multi-instance for shared WhatsApp.

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/EvolutionAPI/evolution-api && cd evolution-api`

2. Edit `docker-compose.yml`: Set `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY`, add to network (`nextmavens-net`).

3. Start: `docker compose up -d`

4. Instances: POST to `/instance/create` for multi-app. Share via API keys.

5. Network: `docker network create nextmavens-net && docker network connect nextmavens-net supabase-master_kong_1`

#### Step 6: Storage Optimization with Cloudinary

1. Install SDK in apps: `npm install cloudinary`

2. Handler example (Node.js):

   ```

   const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

   cloudinary.config({ cloud_name: 'yourname', api_key: 'key', api_secret: 'secret' });

   // On upload (e.g., email attachment):

   cloudinary.uploader.upload('path/to/file', { resource_type: 'auto' }, (err, res) => {

     if (res) {

       // Save res.secure_url to DB/email

       require('fs').unlinkSync('path/to/file');

     }

   });

   ```

3. Cron cleanup: `crontab -e` add `0 * * * * find /uploads -type f -delete`

#### Step 7: Automated Backups to Telegram

Use Python script (from azerothcore repo).

1. Bot: Create via @BotFather; get token. Add to private channel as admin (get chat_id via `/getupdates`).

2. Script (`backup.py`):

   ```

   import os

   import requests

   TOKEN = 'your_token'

   CHAT_ID = 'your_chat_id'

   os.system('docker exec supabase-master_db_1 pg_dump -U postgres > backup.sql')

   files = {'document': open('backup.sql', 'rb')}

   requests.post(f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TOKEN}/sendDocument?chat_id={CHAT_ID}', files=files)

   os.remove('backup.sql')

   ```

3. Install deps: `pip3 install requests`

4. Schedule: `crontab -e` add `0 0 * * * python3 /path/to/backup.py`

#### Step 8: Build Next.js Dashboard

For redirects, orgs/projects, MCPs. RBAC via Supabase Auth.

1. Node: `curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs`

2. App: `npx create-next-app@latest nextmavens-dashboard --ts --eslint --tailwind`

3. Features:

   - Auth: `@supabase/supabase-js` for login.

   - Pages: `/dashboard` redirects (e.g., to Supabase `/supabase`, Evolution `/whatsapp`).

   - Orgs/Projects: Forms to create (call psql/scripts).

   - MCPs: Module for AI API (e.g., query DB, generate tokens).

   - Style: Tailwind – neutral, professional (e.g., font-family: 'Inter').

4. Deploy: `npm run build; npm i -g pm2; pm2 start npm --name dashboard -- run start`

5. Nginx: `sudo apt install nginx`

   ```

   server {

       listen 80;

       server_name nextmavens.cloud;

       location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; }

   }

   ```

   `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx`

6. HTTPS: `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx; sudo certbot --nginx`

#### Step 9: Real-Time and Domains

- Realtime: Use Supabase client for WebSockets.

- Domains: Nginx blocks for subdomains (e.g., `app1.nextmavens.cloud`). Custom: CNAME to your domain.

#### Step 10: Shared Dependencies

In app Dockerfiles: Use multi-stage/base images.

Example:

```

FROM node:20 AS base

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json .

RUN npm ci  # Cached layer

COPY . .

FROM base AS prod

RUN npm run build

```

Reuse `base` across apps.

#### Step 11: Testing/Security

- Test: Deploy sample app, integrate WhatsApp, backup.

- Security: `sudo ufw allow 80,443,8000,8080; sudo ufw enable`. Monitor with `docker stats`.
