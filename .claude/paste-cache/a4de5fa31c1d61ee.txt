  1. PostgreSQL (The Database)

  Regular SQL database, but with special extensions:
  - pg_net - HTTP requests from SQL
  - pgjwt - JWT handling in SQL
  - pgcrypto - Encryption
  - postgis - Geospatial data

  2. PostgREST (Auto REST API)

  -- Your database has a "users" table

  -- PostgREST automatically creates:
  GET    /users          -- Get all users
  GET    /users?id=1     -- Get user with id=1
  POST   /users          -- Create user
  PUT    /users?id=1     -- Update user
  DELETE /users?id=1     -- Delete user

  You don't write API endpoints - they're generated from your database schema.

  3. Realtime (The Magic Part)

  Here's how real-time subscriptions work:

  // Your app subscribes to changes
  supabase
    .channel('users')
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: '*',    // INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'users'
    }, (payload) => {
      console.log('Change received!', payload)
    })
    .subscribe()

  Behind the scenes:

  1. PostgreSQL replication stream detects a change
  2. Realtime server (Elixir) picks it up
  3. Converts to WebSocket message
  4. Sends to your browser
  5. Your app receives the update instantly

  4. GoTrue (Authentication)

  Handles auth completely:
  - Email/password login
  - OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)
  - Magic links
  - JWT tokens
  - Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
