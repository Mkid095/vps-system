STORY: US-008 - Add User Filtering
========================

DESCRIPTION:
As a developer, I want to filter users so that I can find specific accounts.

MAVEN STEPS COMPLETED:
[5, 10]

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
Created comprehensive user filtering UI components with filter bar, date range pickers, dropdowns for status/auth provider, and integrated with existing auth service API client. The users page at /dashboard/users displays paginated, filterable user list.

KEY FILES:
- developer-portal/src/features/auth-users/components/UserFilterBar.tsx - Collapsible filter bar with all filters (email, status, auth_provider, date ranges)
- developer-portal/src/features/auth-users/components/UserList.tsx - Paginated user list with filtering integration
- developer-portal/src/app/dashboard/users/page.tsx - Users management page
- developer-portal/src/lib/api/auth-service-client.ts - Already existed, has full filtering support
- developer-portal/src/lib/types/auth-user.types.ts - Already existed, UserListQuery type

DECISIONS MADE:
- Used existing auth service API client which already had full filtering support
- Created separate UserFilterBar component for reusability
- Used lucide-react icons instead of emojis for professional appearance
- Implemented collapsible filter bar to save screen space
- Used solid professional colors (emerald, slate, blue, etc.) per quality standards

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Uses authServiceClient.listUsers() API with UserListQuery parameters
- Accessible at /dashboard/users route in developer portal
- Requires authentication (checks localStorage accessToken)
- Uses EndUserListQuery, EndUserStatus, EndUserAuthProvider types

LESSONS LEARNED:
- The auth service API client already had comprehensive filtering support built-in
- TypeScript union types work well for dropdown options (status, auth_provider)
- HTML5 date inputs provide browser-level validation for date ranges
- Component size limits (<300 lines) require careful separation of concerns
