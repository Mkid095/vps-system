# Story US-001: Create Users Tab in Studio

**Status:** COMPLETE (Already Implemented)

## Summary
Users tab was already fully implemented in the Studio sidebar navigation.

## What Was Found
The Users tab exists in `/home/ken/developer-portal/src/app/studio/[slug]/page.tsx`:
- Line 31: `{ id: 'users', label: 'Users', icon: Users }` in navItems array
- Lines 21-22: UserList and UserDetail components imported
- Lines 225-238: Complete rendering logic for user management

## Acceptance Criteria Status
1. ✅ Users tab added to Studio sidebar - Line 31
2. ✅ Tab shows user list by default - UserList component rendered by default
3. ✅ Integrated into Studio navigation - Part of navItems array
4. ✅ Typecheck passes - Verified with `pnpm run typecheck`

## Key Files
- `/home/ken/developer-portal/src/app/studio/[slug]/page.tsx` - Main Studio page with sidebar
- `/home/ken/developer-portal/src/features/auth-users/components/UserList.tsx` - User list component
- `/home/ken/developer-portal/src/features/auth-users/components/UserDetail.tsx` - User detail view

## Integration Points
- Sidebar navigation uses `activeNav` state to switch between tabs
- Users tab is second item in navItems after "Tables"
- Uses Users icon from lucide-react
- Connected to UserList/UserDetail components via props

## Notes
This story was already complete. No implementation was needed.
