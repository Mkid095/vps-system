STORY: US-006 - Implement Reset Password
========================

DESCRIPTION:
As a developer, I want to reset user passwords so that I can help users who forgot credentials.

MAVEN STEPS COMPLETED:
[1, 2, 5, 7, 10]

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
Created password reset functionality for end-users in the Studio User Management interface. Added API route that integrates with auth service, and UI component in UserDetail with loading/success/error states.

KEY FILES:
- developer-portal/src/app/api/auth/users/[userId]/reset-password/route.ts - API endpoint
- developer-portal/src/features/users/components/ResetPasswordButton.tsx - UI component
- developer-portal/src/features/users/types.ts - TypeScript types
- developer-portal/src/features/admin/users/UserDetail.tsx - Integrated button

DECISIONS MADE:
- Used existing auth service client method `resetEndUserPassword()`
- Button placed in "Account Actions" section of UserDetail
- Success message auto-hides after 5 seconds
- Followed same authentication pattern as disable/enable user endpoints

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Calls auth service API: /users/{userId}/reset-password
- Uses authenticateRequest middleware for JWT validation
- Reads accessToken from localStorage (documented XSS TODO for httpOnly cookies)

LESSONS LEARNED:
- All quality standards met (no 'any' types, no gradients, @/ imports, <300 lines)
- Typecheck passes with zero errors
- Security audit passed (9/10) - rate limiting recommended for production
