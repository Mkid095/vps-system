STORY: US-007 - Document Backup Strategy
========================================

DESCRIPTION: As a developer, I want clear documentation about backups so that I understand what's covered.

MAVEN STEPS COMPLETED: [5, 10]

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
Created comprehensive backup documentation in two locations: a detailed technical README and a user-friendly developer portal page. Documentation covers database backups (manual export), storage backups (Telegram automatic for files >2GB), logs export, restore procedures, retention policy, and security considerations.

KEY FILES:
- /home/ken/docs/backup-strategy/README.md (775 lines - comprehensive technical docs)
- /home/ken/developer-portal/src/app/docs/backups/page.tsx (362 lines - portal page)
- /home/ken/developer-portal/src/app/docs/page.tsx (updated index)

DECISIONS MADE:
- Two-tier documentation approach: comprehensive README for technical details + user-friendly portal page for quick reference
- Used Lucide-react icons for professional visual design
- Organized into clear sections: Overview, Backup Types, Restore, Security, Best Practices

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Links to backup dashboard (/dashboard/backups)
- References existing backup APIs and services
- Connects to authentication system (JWT with scopes)

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Documentation should cover both technical implementation and user-facing guides
- Security documentation is critical for backup/restore operations
- Visual design (cards, icons) improves documentation usability
- Always include authentication and authorization details in docs
